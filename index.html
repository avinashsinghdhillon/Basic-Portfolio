        <p>
             I started programming in the 7th grade as a hobby on a tiny ZX Spectrum microcomputer 
            and have always loved it. The first language I learnt was "Spectrum Basic" which was a subset of Basic.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have 4 years of development experience in C#, SQL Server, MS Access among other associated 
            tools like XML, SSRS etc.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            I am currently enrolled in the UT Austin's Web Development bootcamp and am learning exciting new technologies 
            like JavaScript, HTML5, CSS Bootstrap and React.js.
